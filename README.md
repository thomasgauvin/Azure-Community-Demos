| [APIM Terraform](https://github.com/hugogirard/apimTerraform) | [hugogirard](https://github.com/hugogirard) | This Github show a simple CI/CD using Terraform to publish your APIs in Azure API Management. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35609369/150876210-4dc22a90-6c79-4ec1-ae93-4105df081f28.png) | azure api management, terraform |
| [Text-to-Speech Demo](https://github.com/hugogirard/textToSpeechDemo) | [hugogirard](https://github.com/hugogirard) | This demo exposes an Azure Architecture using Azure Cognitive Services to convert text to audio. The user enters a text in a Blazor Server web app. A job is created and an azure function is triggered, the function will call Azure Cognitive Services to detect the text language (currently french and english are supported). When the text is detected another function will be triggered and will call again Azure Cognitive Services to conver the text to audio file and save it in a blob. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35609369/150875709-72c9713a-9fba-4f99-9884-6e8d3d7cee23.png) | azure cognitive services, azure functions, azure blob storage |
| [Secure Logic App Using Azure AD and APIM](https://github.com/hugogirard/secureLogicApp) | [hugogirard](https://github.com/hugogirard) | This sample show a way to secure your Logic App with Azure Active Directory and exposed using Azure Api Management. Another logic app will call the protected logic retrieving a JWT token from Azure AD. An Azure policy will validate the JWT token inside APIM to be sure the audience is valid. The protected logic app have an IP restriction that accepts HTTP call only from the public IP of Api Management. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35609369/150875981-8d024c38-e150-42ed-b267-21e9c939dcf6.png) | azure logic apps, azure active directory |
| [Parse documents with Azure Form Recognizer and Logic Apps and display the results in a PowerApp](https://github.com/thomasgauvin/Parse-documents-with-Azure-Form-Recognizer-and-Logic-Apps-and-display-the-results-in-a-PowerApp) | [thomasgauvin](https://github.com/thomasgauvin) | This application enables an end user to upload a PDF and see the parsed results in the UI. The UI is built with PowerApps and the background processing is achieved with Azure Logic Apps and Azure Form Recognizer | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35609369/150877750-d20a1302-da54-4251-a979-d0bf69c77fdb.png) | azure form recognizer, azure logic apps, powerapp canvas |
| [Add Text-to-Speech to your website using Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Functions to authorize requests.](https://github.com/thomasgauvin/Azure-Cognitive-Services-Speech-Azure-Functions-demo) | [thomasgauvin](https://github.com/thomasgauvin) | Add Text-to-Speech to your website using Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Functions to authorize requests. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35609369/150877908-a31d44a8-d88b-472e-ac85-2b407f15a5eb.png) | azure functions, azure cognitive services | 
| [Resume Parsing/CV Knowledge Engine Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/thomasgauvin/cv-knowledge-engine-accelerator) | [thomasgauvin](https://github.com/thomasgauvin) | The CV Knowledge Engine solution accelerator aims to provides a quick way of creating an intelligent search engine, that enables searching and filtering through CV and resume documents. It leverages Knowledge Mining and Cognitive Services technologies, to extract all the valuable information and insights from the CV documents, like names, contact information, years of experience, skills and qualifications, ..etc. It also creates an intuitive, easy-to-navigate user interface, that allows for a full search experience with capabilities like searching with search terms, customized filters, and informative result cards. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35609369/150878215-a1bf295b-c7b2-4c44-9d5b-7b95d8f726c7.png) | azure functions, azure cognitive search, azure cognitive services, azure app service |
